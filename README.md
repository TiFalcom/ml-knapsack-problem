# Knapsack Problem with Genetic Algorithms
In the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity . If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all. In that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.

## Enviroment

To setup your enviroment create a virtual enviroment and install the requirements:  

``` bash
pip install -r requirements
```

## Model

The experiments are all executed on jupyter notebook [knapsack-problems](notebooks/knapsack-problem.ipynb)
